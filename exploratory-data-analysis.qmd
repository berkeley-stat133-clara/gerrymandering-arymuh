### Answer 2

### Question 3

For which districts that were Democrat vs. Republican did Democrats take majority of votes? How many vote did they win by?

    ggplot(aes(x = CDDIST, y = CNGDEM01-CNGREP01)) + geom_col() + theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Number of excess Democratic votes within winning districts", x = "District Number", y = "Number of Votes Democrats won by")
```
